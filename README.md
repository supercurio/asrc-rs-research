# asrc-rs-research

Tools built to experiment with the implementation of an asynchronous sample rate converter designed
to keep in sync audio input and output running in different clock domains.  
Meant to be used in [MultiDSP](https://github.com/supercurio/multidsp)

Programming language: Rust.

Each utility is likely buggy, incomplete and may become obsolete later on.
